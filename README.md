## ⚠️ Academic Integrity

> **Please do not copy solutions directly.**

These codes are shared **for educational purposes only** — to help others understand how certain problems can be approached and solved.  
If you’re currently taking similar courses, I **strongly encourage you to try the problems yourself first**.  
You can then refer to these assignments for **guidance, hints, or debugging help**.

Learning through problem-solving is the best way to grow as a developer!
